# Module 1 Mandatory assignment: Little Animal Horror Zoo

Imagine that you are designing a computer game. The game is text based, meaning that no graphics are involved, so only a text story printed in the console.

The game is at the moment not able to take any instructions from the person who plays the game (you), but it can only do what you will code it to do. You can think of it as a “Demo” game that shows how it could be played, but in fact is not playable yet.

The game consists of 2 animals: a rabbit and a snake.
The screen consists of coordinate system with an x and y axis, 10 on each axis. So the animals can be located by the number they are on. In this text based game you can not see where the animals are at a given time, but they should “tell” it to the console, every time they have moved, like this: 

_“I am the nice rabbit, i am now standing on square 1, 3”_   
_“I am the evil snake, i am now standing on the square 3, 10”_

So both the rabbit and the snake should be able to move.
And they should both be able to tell about their position. 
The snake should be able to kill the rabbit if they are on the same coordinates. 
And the rabbit should be able to ask for mercy just before it is killed, maybe if the snake is on a neighboring square.

You should do this in groups of approx. 3.

## You should hand in the following:
* Your Java code
* Use cases
* Domain Model
* Class Diagram
* Other, eg. comments/thoughts etc.
If you create multiple versions of use cases, domain model or class diagram, you should hand in each version with a version number on them.

Your hand in must be a repository on Github and you must upload a link to the repository on Fronter.

### To hand in to a repository on Github, do the following
(This will be demonstrated in class)  
Each group should do this, not each group member

1. Create a new Github repository  
2. Navigate to the root folder of your project with the files you want to hand in.  
3. git init  
4. git commit -m "module 1 hand in"  
5. git remote add *link to your github repository*  
6. git push origin master
